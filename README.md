# Jakarta EE Platform Specification <img src="assets/images/jakarta_ee_logo_schooner_color_stacked_default.png" width="250"/>

This is the project for the Jakarta EE Platform specification.  The Jakarta
EE Platform specification is the umbrella specification that defines
the Jakarta EE platform.  The platform specification doesn't define the
Jakarta EE APIs directly, but rather includes them by reference to other
Jakarta specifications and defines how they all fit together in the
overall Jakarta EE platform.  The platform specification also defines
other attributes of the platform such as security, deployment,
transactions, and interoperability.

## API Specifications

The API specifications for the Jakarta EE platform are collected together here:

* [Jakarta EE APIs](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/apidocs/)
* [Jakarta Server Faces Tag Libraries](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/2.3/vdldoc/)
* [Jakarta Server Faces Standard HTML RenderKit](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/2.3/renderkitdoc)
* [Jakarta Server Faces JavaScript Documentation](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/2.3/jsdoc)

The [Specifications](Specifications) page contains links to the project
pages for all Jakarta EE specifications.

(Be sure to view this page at
[https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/](https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/),
not at the GitHub source code repository view, so that the links in
this page will work correctly.)

## Jakarta EE 8

Java EE 8 was approved by the Jakarta EE Specification Committee
on Sep 10, 2019.
The final specification is available for download on the
[Jakarta EE specification page](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/).

## Project Communication

You can track all the platform project communication by
subscribing to the jakartaee-platform-dev mailing list.
To subscribe, or to browse the archives, see the
[jakartaee-platform-dev page](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/jakartaee-platform-dev).

You can find the drafts of proposals and other working
documents on the [Documents](Documents) page.
(Currently this contains only historical Java EE proposals.)

## Compatibility Requirements

The rules we follow to ensure backwards compatibility when revising
Jakarta EE specifications are described on the
[Compatibility Requirements](CompatibilityRequirements) page.

## JCP Processes

The use of JCP processes by the Java EE group at Oracle is described on the
[JCP Processes](JCPProcesses) page.
(This page has not been updated to reflect the Jakarta EE Specification Process.)

## Annotation Rules

Annotations are used heavily in the Jakarta EE programming model.
It's important that all Jakarta EE specifications define and use
annotations in a consistent way.
We've written up some [DRAFT rules on how annotations work](AnnotationRules).
