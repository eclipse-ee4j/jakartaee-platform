== Transaction Management

This chapter describes the required Jakarta Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE)
transaction management and runtime environment.

Product Providers must transparently support transactions that involve multiple
components and transactional resources within a single Jakarta EE product, as
described in this chapter.
This requirement must be met regardless of whether the Jakarta EE product
is implemented as a single process, multiple processes on the same
network node, or multiple processes on multiple network nodes.

If the following components are included in a Jakarta EE product, they are
considered transactional resources and must behave as specified here:

* JDBC connections
* Jakarta Messaging sessions
* Resource adapter connections for resource adapters specifying the
_XATransaction_ transaction level

=== Overview

A Jakarta EE Product that includes both a servlet container and an enterprise
bean container must support a transactional application comprised of
combinations of web application components accessing multiple enterprise beans
within a single transaction. If the Jakarta EE product also includes support
for the Connectors specification, each component may also acquire one or more
connections to access one or more transactional resource managers.

For example, in
_<<a475, Servlets/Server Pages Accessing Enterprise Beans>>_ , the call
tree starts from a servlet or server pages accessing multiple enterprise beans,
which in turn may access other enterprise beans. The components access resource
managers via connections.

=== Servlets/Server Pages Accessing Enterprise Beans

image:../images/Platform_Spec-8.png[image]

The Application Component Provider specifies, using a combination of
programmatic and declarative transaction demarcation APIs, how the platform
must manage transactions on behalf of the application.

For example, the application may require that all the components in
_<<a475, Servlets/Server Pages Accessing Enterprise Beans>>_ access
resources as part of a single transaction. The Platform Provider must provide
the transaction capabilities to support such a scenario.

This specification does not define how the components and the resources are
partitioned or distributed within a single Jakarta EE product. In order to
achieve the transactional semantics required by the application, the Jakarta EE
Product Provider is free to execute the application components sharing a
transaction in the same Java virtual machine, or distribute them across multiple
virtual machines, in accordance with the requirements of the component
specifications.

The rest of this chapter describes the transactional requirements for a Jakarta
EE product in more detail.

=== Requirements

This section defines the transaction support requirements of Jakarta EE Products
that must be supported by Product Providers.

==== Web Components

Web components may demarcate transactions using the
_javax.transaction.UserTransaction_ interface or transactional interceptors,
which are defined in the Jakarta Transactions specification. They may access
multiple resource managers and invoke multiple enterprise beans within a single
transaction. The specified transaction context is automatically propagated to
the enterprise beans and transactional resource managers. The result of the
propagation may be subject to the enterprise bean transaction attributes
(for example, a bean may be required to use Container Managed Transactions).

Web application event listeners and upgrade handlers must not demarcate
transactions using the _javax.transaction.UserTransaction_ interface or
transactional interceptors. Servlet filters may use transactional resources
within their _doFilter_ methods but should not use any transactional resources
in the methods of any objects used to wrap the request or response
objects.

==== Transaction Requirements

The Jakarta EE platform must meet the following requirements:

* The Jakarta EE platform must provide an object implementing the
_javax.transaction.UserTransaction_ interface to all web components.
The platform must publish the _UserTransaction_ object in the Java™ Naming
and Directory Interface (JNDI) name space available to web components under the
name _java:comp/UserTransaction_.
* The Jakarta EE platform must provide classes
that implement the transactional interceptors, as defined by the Jakarta
Transactions specification.
* If a web component invokes an enterprise bean from a thread associated with a
transaction defined by the Jakarta Transactions specification, the Jakarta EE
platform must propagate the transaction context with the enterprise bean
invocation. Whether the target enterprise bean will be invoked in this
transaction context or not is determined by the rules defined in the Jakarta
Enterprise Beans specification.

Note that this transaction propagation
requirement applies only to invocations of enterprise beans in the same
Jakarta EE product instance as the invoking component. Invocations of enterprise
beans in another Jakarta EE product instance (for example, using the Jakarta
Enterprise Beans interoperability protocol) need not propagate the transaction
context. See the Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification for details.

* If a web component accesses a transactional resource manager from a thread
associated with a transaction defined by the Jakarta Transactions specification,
the Jakarta EE platform must ensure that the resource access is included as part
of the transaction defined by the Jakarta Transactions specification.
* If a web component creates a thread, the Java EE platform must ensure that the
newly created thread is not associated with any transaction defined by the
Jakarta Transactions specification.

[[a493]]
=== Transaction Non-Requirements

The Product Provider is not required to support the importing of a transaction
context from a client to a web component.

The Product Provider is not required to support transaction context propagation
via an HTTP request across web components. The HTTP protocol does not support
such transaction context propagation. When a web component associated with a
transaction makes an HTTP request to another web component, the transaction
context is not propagated to the target servlet or page.

However, when a web component is invoked through the _RequestDispatcher_
interface, any active transaction context must be propagated to the called
servlet or server pages.

==== Transactions in Web Component Life Cycles

Transactions may not span web requests from a client on the network. If a web
component starts a transaction in the _service_ or _doFilter_ method (or
transactional interceptor of _service_ or _doFilter_ method), it must be
completed before the _service_ or _doFilter_ method returns to the network
clientlink:#a3650[3]. Returning from the _service_ or _doFilter_ method to the
network client with an active transaction context is an error. The web container
is required to detect this error and abort the transaction.

As specified above in <<a493, Transaction Non-Requirements>>, requests
made within a web container using the _RequestDispatcher_ must propagate any
transaction context to the called class. Unless the called class commits or
aborts the transaction, the transaction must remain active when the called class
returns.

If a servlet that is called via the _RequestDispatcher_ starts a transaction,
the behavior of the container with regard to that transaction is unspecified
when the servlet returns from its service method. The web container may throw
an exception to the caller, abort the transaction and return to the caller
without error, or propagate the transaction context back to the caller.
Portable servlets will complete any transaction they start before returning from
the service method.

==== Transactions and Threads

There are many subtle and complex interactions between the use of transactional
resources and threads. To ensure correct operation, web components should obey
the following guidelines, and the web container must support at least these
usages.

* Transactions defined by the Jakarta Transactions specification should be
started and completed in the thread in which the _service_ method is called.
Additional threads that are created for any purpose should not attempt
to start transactions defined by the Jakarta Transactions specification.
* Transactional resources may be acquired and released by a thread other than
the _service_ method thread, but should not be shared between threads.
* Transactional resource objects (for example, JDBC _Connection_ objects) should
not be stored in static fields. Such objects can only be associated with one
transaction at a time. Storing them in static fields would make it easy to
erroneously share them between threads in different transactions.
* Web components implementing
_SingleThreadModel_ may store top-level transactional resource objects
in class instance fields. A top-level object is one acquired directly
from a container managed connection factory object (for example, a JDBC
_Connection_ acquired from a JDBC _ConnectionFactory_ ), as opposed to
other objects acquired from these top-level objects (for example, a JDBC
_Statement_ acquired from a JDBC _Connection_ ). The web container
ensures that requests to a _SingleThreadModel_ servlet are serialized
and thus only one thread and one transaction will be able to use the
object at a time, and that the top-level object will be enlisted in any
new transaction started by the component.
* In web components not implementing _SingleThreadModel_ , transactional
resource objects, as well as Java Persistence _EntityManager_ objects, should
not be stored in class instance fields, and should be acquired and released
within the same invocation of the _service_ method.
* Web components that are called by other web components
(using the _forward_ or _include_ methods) should not store transactional
resource objects in class instance fields.
* Enterprise beans may be invoked from any thread used by a web component.
Transaction context propagation requirements are described above and in the
Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification.

==== Jakarta Enterprise Beans

The Jakarta EE Product Provider must provide support for transactions as defined
in the Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification.

==== Application Clients

The Jakarta EE Product Provider is not required to provide transaction
management support for application clients.

==== Applet Clients

The Jakarta EE Product Provider is not required to provide transaction
management support for applets.

[[a516]]
=== Transactional JDBC™ Technology Support

A Jakarta EE product must support a JDBC technology database as a transactional
resource manager. The platform must enable transactional JDBC API access from
web components and enterprise beans.

It must be possible to access the JDBC technology database from multiple
application components within a single transaction. For example, a servlet may
wish to start a transaction, access a database, invoke an enterprise bean that
accesses the same database as part of the same transaction, and, finally,
commit the transaction.

A Jakarta EE product must provide a transaction manager that is capable of
coordinating two-phase commit operations across multiple XA-capable JDBC
databases. If a JDBC driver supports the Jakarta Transactions API’s XA
interfaces (in the _javax.transaction.xa_ package), then the Jakarta EE product
must be capable of using the XA interfaces provided by the JDBC driver to
accomplish two-phase commit operations. The Jakarta EE product may discover
the XA capabilities of JDBC drivers through product-specific means, although
normally such JDBC drivers would be delivered as resource adapters using the
Connector API.

[[a520]]
=== Transactional Jakarta Messaging Support

A Jakarta EE product must support a Jakarta Messaging provider as a
transactional resource manager. The platform must enable transactional Jakarta
Messaging access from servlets, server pages, and enterprise beans.

It must be possible to access the Jakarta Messaging provider from multiple
application components within a single transaction. For example, a servlet may
wish to start a transaction, send a Jakarta Messaging message, invoke an
enterprise bean that also sends a Jakarta Messaging message as part of the same
transaction, and, finally, commit the transaction.

==== Transactional Resource Adapter (Connector) Support

A Jakarta EE product must support resource adapters that use _XATransaction_
mode as transactional resource managers. The platform must enable transactional
access to the resource adapter from servlets, server pages, and enterprise
beans.

It must be possible to access the resource adapter from multiple application
components within a single transaction. For example, a servlet may wish to start
a transaction, access the resource adapter, invoke an enterprise bean that also
accesses the resource adapter as part of the same transaction, and,
finally, commit the transaction.

=== Transaction Interoperability

==== Multiple Jakarta EE Platform Interoperability

This specification does not require the Product Provider to implement any
particular protocol for transaction interoperability across multiple Jakarta EE
products. Jakarta EE compatibility requires neither interoperability among
identical Jakarta EE products from the same Product Provider, nor among
heterogeneous Jakarta EE products from multiple Product Providers.

We recommend that Jakarta EE Product Providers use the IIOP transaction
propagation protocol defined by OMG and described in the OTS specification,
transaction interoperability when using the Jakarta Enterprise Beans
interoperability protocol based on RMI-IIOP.

==== Support for Transactional Resource Managers

This specification requires all Jakarta EE products to support the
_javax.transaction.xa.XAResource_ interface, as specified in the Connector
specification. This specification also requires all Jakarta EE products to
support the _javax.transaction.xa.XAResource_ interface for performing two-phase
commit operations on JDBC drivers that support the JTA XA APIs. This
specification does not require that JDBC drivers or Jakarta Messaging providers
use the _javax.transaction.xa.XAResource_ interface, although they may use
this interface and in all cases they must meet the transactional resource
manager requirements described in this chapter. In particular, it must be
possible to combine operations on one or more JDBC databases, one or more
Jakarta Messaging sessions, one or more enterprise beans, and multiple resource
adapters supporting the _XATransaction_ mode in a single transaction defined by
the Jakarta Transactions specification.

=== Local Transaction Optimization

==== Requirements

If a transaction uses a single resource manager, performance may be improved by
using a resource manager specific local optimization. A local transaction is
typically more efficient than a global transaction and provides better
performance. Local optimization is not available for transactions that are
imported from a different container.

Containers may choose to provide local transaction optimization, but are not
required to do so. Local transaction optimization must be transparent to a
Jakarta EE application.

The following section describes a possible mechanism for local transaction
optimization by containers.

==== A Possible Design

This section illustrates how the previously described requirements might be
implemented.

When the first connection to a resource manager is established as part of the
transaction, a resource manager specific local transaction is started on the
connection. Any subsequent connection acquired as part of the transaction that
can share the local transaction on the first connection is allowed to share the
local transaction.

A global transaction is started lazily under the following conditions:

* When a subsequent connection cannot share the resource manager local
transaction on the first connection, or if it uses a different resource manager.
* When a transaction is exported to a different container.

After the lazy start of a global transaction, any subsequent connection acquired
may either share the local transaction on the first connection, or be part of
the global transaction, depending on the resource manager it accesses.

When a transaction completion (commit or rollback) is attempted, there are two
possibilities:

* If only a single resource manager had been accessed as part of the
transaction, the transaction is completed using the resource manager specific
local transaction mechanism.
* If a global transaction had been started, the transaction is completed
treating the resource manager local transaction as a last resource in the global
2-phase commit protocol, that is using the last resource 2-phase commit
optimization.

=== Connection Sharing

When multiple connections acquired by a Jakarta EE application use the same
resource manager, containers may choose to provide connection sharing within the
same transaction scope. Sharing connections typically results in efficient usage
of resources and better performance. Containers are required to provide
connection sharing in certain situations; see the Connector specification for
details.

Connections to resource managers acquired by Jakarta EE applications are
considered potentially shared or shareable. A Jakarta EE application component
that intends to use a connection in an unshareable way must provide deployment
information to that effect, to prevent the connection from being shared by the
container. Examples of when this may be needed include situations with changed
security attributes, isolation levels, character settings, and localization
configuration. Containers must not attempt to share connections that are marked
unshareable. If a connection is not marked unshareable, it must be transparent
to the application whether the connection is actually shared or not.

Jakarta EE application components may use the optional _shareable_ element of
the _Resource_ annotation or the optional deployment descriptor element
_res-sharing-scope_ to indicate whether a connection to a resource manager is
shareable or unshareable. Containers must assume connections to be shareable if
no deployment hint is provided. <<a3399, Jakarta EE Application Client
XML Schema>>, the Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification, and the Servlet
specification provide descriptions of the deployment descriptor element.

Jakarta EE application components may cache connection objects and reuse them
across multiple transactions. Containers that provide connection sharing must
transparently switch such cached connection objects (at dispatch time) to point
to an appropriate shared connection with the correct transaction scope. Refer
to the Connector specification for a detailed description of connection
sharing.

=== JDBC and Jakarta Messaging Deployment Issues

The JDBC transaction requirements in <<a516, Transactional JDBC™
Technology Support>> and the Jakarta Messaging transaction requirements in
<<a520, Transactional Jakarta Messaging Support>> may impose some
restrictions on a Deployer’s configuration of an application’s JDBC and Jakarta
Messaging resources. Jakarta EE Product Providers may impose the restrictions
described in this section to meet these requirements.

If the deployer configures a non-XA-capable JDBC resource manager in a
transaction, then a Jakarta EE Product Provider may restrict all JDBC access
within that transaction to that non-XA-capable JDBC resource manager. Otherwise,
a Jakarta EE Product Provider must support use of multiple XA-capable JDBC
resource managers within a transaction. In addition, a Jakarta EE Product
Provider may restrict the security configuration of all JDBC connections within
a transaction to a single user identity. A Jakarta EE Product Provider is not
required to support transactions where more than one JDBC identity is used.
Specifically, this means that transactions that require the use of more than one
JDBC security identity (which can be done explicitly via component provided user
name and password) may not be portable.

A Jakarta EE Product Provider may make the same restrictions as above, resulting
in a transaction being restricted to a single Jakarta Messaging resource manager
and user identity.

In addition, when both a JDBC resource manager and a Jakarta Messaging resource
manager are used in the same transaction, a Jakarta EE Product Provider may
restrict both to a pairing that allows their combination to deliver the full
transactional semantics required by the application, and may restrict the
security identity of both to a single identity. To fully support such usage,
portable applications that wish to include JDBC and Jakarta Messaging access in
a single global transaction must not mark the corresponding transactional
resources as “unshareable”.

Although these restrictions are allowed, it is recommended that Jakarta EE
Product Providers support JDBC and Jakarta Messaging resource managers that
provide full two-phase commit functionality and, as a result, do not impose
these restrictions.

=== Two-Phase Commit Support

A Jakarta EE product must support the use of multiple XA-capable resource
adapters in a single transaction. To support such a scenario, full two-phase
commit support is required. A Jakarta Messaging provider may be provided as an
XA-capable resource adapter. In such a case, it must be possible to include
Jakarta Messaging operations in the same global transaction as other resource
adapters. While JDBC drivers are not required to be XA-capable, a JDBC driver
may be delivered as an XA-capable resource adapter. In such a case, it must be
possible to include JDBC operations in the same global transaction as other
XA-capable resource adapters. See also <<a516, Transactional JDBC™
Technology Support>>.

=== System Administration Tools

Although there are no compatibility requirements for system administration
capabilities, the Jakarta EE Product Provider will typically include tools that
allow the System Administrator to perform the following tasks:

* Integrate transactional resource managers with the platform.
* Configure the transaction management parts of the platform.
* Monitor transactions at runtime.
* Receive notifications of abnormal transaction processing conditions (such as
abnormally high number of transaction rollbacks).
