= Binary Compatibility Levels

This is a classification of the levels of binary compatibility support for Java EE 8 classic applications in terms of the level of difficulty/complexity of the associated implementation and tools.

== Level 0 - Jakarta EE 8 Only
* No transformation required
* Requires a Jakarta EE 8 container
* No mandated support for backwards compatibility
** Up to implementors to decide what level of support to provide

== Level 1 - Jakarta EE 8 Translation to EE 9
* Requires a direct translation of javax.* packages to jakarta.* analog
* Requires transformation of META-INF/services to jakarta analogs
* Requires transformation of properties files referencing javax based properties
* Requires transformation of server specific properties that are classic javax based properties
** This could be a specfic build or deployment step that processes an EE 8 app
* Requires only a Jakarta EE 9 container
* Requires the big bang javax to jakarta approach
** This simplifies the EE9 container

== Level 2 - Colocated Jakarta EE 8/9 with Isolation
* Requires an isolated Jakarta EE 8 container
* Requires an isolated  Jakarta EE 9 container
* No interaction of EE 8 and EE 9 components
* Requires the big bang javax to jakarta approach
** Simplifies the EE9 container implementation in terms of isolating javax packages from jakarta packages.

== Level 3 - Jakarta EE 9 With Mapping from EE 8
* Requires a Jakarta EE 9 container
* Requires a Jakarta EE 8 to EE 9 compatibility layer
* Requires either compatibility or mapping layer for services and properties
* Requires mapping of server specific properties that are classic javax based properties
* Components interact as peers as EE8 components are exposed as EE9
** Unclear what holes exist in a compatibility layer solution
*** Likely some runtime overhead cost
* Could work with either big bang or incremental approach
** Incremental approach has increasing complexity as more javax APIs evolve
*** How to track how an EE8 app is handled beyond EE 9 is the issue
** Big bang would have the simplest evolution path beyond EE 9

== Level 4 - Colocated Jakarta EE 8 and EE 9 with API Mixing
* Supports side by side javax.* and jakarta.* components in one application
* Requires a Jakarta EE 9 container with native support for EE 8 components
* Theoretically does not require any pre-processing of EE 8 application
* Allows incremental approach
* Likely large technical challenges in bridging between the EE 8 and 9 components
