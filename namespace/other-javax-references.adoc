# Other javax references in APIs

Code that calls a method in the javax namespace and will need migration in the future is easy to spot and handle with bytecode changes.  Outside these usages, there are other uses of `javax` that may need to be considered.

These will generally fall into the following categories:

 - TODO: Joakim you had a great list


The following is a more specific audit of each spec.

## EJB

Classpath Resources:

 - `META-INF/services/javax.ejb.spi.EJBContainerProvider`

System & Config Properties:

 - `javax.ejb.embeddable.provider`
 - `javax.ejb.embeddable.appName`
 - `javax.ejb.embeddable.modules`


## JPA

## JSF

## TODO Help list every spec

## JTA
The following classes are referenced from `javax.sql.XAConnection`which is still part of JavaSE
* `javax.transaction.xa.XAResource`
* `javax.transaction.xa.XAException`
* `javax.transaction.xa.Xid`

## Security

`javax.security` might be part of JavaSE still?
Some parts are defined by the servlet spec though it seems.

## atinject
JSR-330 ('atinject') is now owned by Oracle but developed by an independent group of individuals.
Atinject is fully ALv2 licensed and thus also has an implicit license grant.
I doubt that there are any trademark issues hidden in the docs and code but we need to do a double-check on that.

There are 2 open questions:
* Do we want to move `javax.inject` to `jakarta.inject) at all?
* Would this only affect all downstream users of atinject (Maven, picocontainer, etc) or will JakartaEE move the atinject spec into it's own teritory?
